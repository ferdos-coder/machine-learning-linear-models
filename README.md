## Project Overview

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with linear models in machine learning, particularly linear regression. Using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas, it covers:

- Loading and exploring datasets  
- Preparing data for modeling  
- Training linear regression models  
- Saving and loading trained models  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Practical examples with real datasets  

The project is ideal for beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand how linear models work and how to implement them effectively.
